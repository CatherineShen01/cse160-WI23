> ### Error like: launch-cse160-ssh.sh for SSH using VSCode

Replace launch-cse160-ssh.sh using with `/opt/dsmlp-course-launch-scripts/bin/launch-cse160-ssh.sh`

or

If you run "which launch-cse160-ssh.sh", you'll (hopefully) see `/opt/dsmlp-course-launch-scripts/bin/launch-cse160-ssh.sh` in the command line. If not, you'll need to add `/opt/dsmlp-course-launch-scripts/bin` to your path variable.

> ### Error like: Failed to parse remote port from server output

Try removing `dsmlp-login` and `vscode-dsmlp` from `/Users/rithvik/.ssh/known_hosts`
